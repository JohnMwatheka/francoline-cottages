          <h2> Lake Naivasha   </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Lake Naivasha is a popular holiday destination for tourists, who come to see the lake's abundant wildlife and enjoy many outdoor activities like a boat safari. The lake is home to over 1500 hippos and 400 species of birds, which makes it a haven for birdwatchers. In addition to its wildlife, Lake Naivasha is also known for its beautiful scenery. Lake Naivasha is a large freshwater lake located at an altitude of 1884 meters above sea level, which makes it the highest large lake in Kenya. It’s popular for its high population of hippos and birdlife. From Chui Lodge, you can reach the lake within 20 minutes and i highly recommend doing a boat safari on Lake Naivasha. Chui lodge also offers a two-lake experience, where you not only visit <b>Lake Naivasha</b>, but also the connected volcanic crater lake, named <b>Lake Oloidien</b>. It's a community project - Chui Lodge is the product of the local community coming together. Made from bush, stone and wood all sustainably sourced from within the sanctuary - every piece of furniture at the lodge was made with care at the on-site workshop and is completely unique. Incredible views - Each cottage comes with its own veranda, offering breathtaking views of the Rift Valley escarpment. Lounge in the swimming pool and look out over the watering hole where giraffes come to drink. It's environmentally friendly - Not only is the lodge made from naturally sourced materials, but the expert chefs use ingredients sourced from Chui Lodge's very own organic fruit and vegetable farm. The accommodation is split into eight individual and spaced-out luxurious cottages with incredible views of the Rift Valley. Five are standard rooms and three are deluxe rooms - all rooms are en suite. The deluxe rooms have their very own lounge areas, each with a unique view of the surrounding wilderness. Some overlook the lush gardens towards the pond and others have spectacular views of the wildlife in front of the lodge. Each room is completely unique in design, furnished with magnificent four-poster king-size beds made of olive wood, roaring log fires, and stunning decor. Also available is Chui House - a four-bedroom house situated on the wildlife corridor overlooking Mula Hill and Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary and is a self-catered home away from home. There are two beautifully decorated double en suite bedrooms as well as 2 twin en-suite bedrooms which can become doubles if need be. Chui House boasts a spacious but cosy lounge fitted with a fireplace and dining area connected to the courtyard and veranda, with views over the garden towards the wildlife sanctuary. Take time in the afternoon to relax under the Acacia trees, explore the manicured garden or sip a glass of wine whilst watching giraffes drink at the waterhole below. Chui Lodge has professionally trained chefs on-site to prepare a delicious array of food for you during your stay. All ingredients used are sourced from their organic fruit and vegetable farm. Dine on your four-course meal by a log fire or under the stars, listening to the sound of the African bush. Whether you're enjoying a family meal or a romantic private dinner, the lodge can cater to every atmosphere. Considered Naivasha’s best-kept secret, Chui Lodge offers very comfortable accommodation in a spectacular location! It’s an excellent option for travellers seeking something special in the Rift Valley region. Chui Lodge is one of two properties situated within the Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary. This sanctuary was established by Hans and June Zwager and their son Peter in 1995, with the joint aim of conserving the area’s wildlife and managing human–wildlife conflicts to enable both local communities and animals to thrive. Chui combines well with a safari in the Maasai Mara or Amboseli National Park – please contact one of our experts to discuss your options! The accommodation at Chui is usually booked on a full-board basis and the lodge is open throughout the year. Chui Lodge is a 2.5-hour drive from Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya, or a twenty-minute flight from Nairobi. It’s an easy drive from Nairobi and the road conditions are good, although the last stretch is a bit bumpier because of potholes. The Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary surrounding Chui Lodge was created in the mid-1990s with the sole purpose of giving the resident wildlife a place of safety and refuge. To keep illegal cattle grazers out of the sanctuary and wildlife from straying into the farmlands, the sanctuary is surrounded by electric fences. The wildlife is still able to move freely between the neighboring Hell’s Gate National Park and the lake shore by way of wildlife corridors, which are areas that act as a safe transition zone for migratory animals. This stimulates constant movement throughout the localized ecosystem. Within the private 18,000-acre Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary you can find over 50 mammal species including leopard, hyena, wildebeest, hartebeest, waterbuck, eland, Grevy’s zebra, buffalo, Impala, dikdik and giraffes. Lions occasionally use the wildlife corridors but never stay too long in the area. The sanctuary also has various birds! Apart from the smaller birds, we spotted for example the African Fish Eagle, Somali Ostrich, Secretary bird, and vultures.

        <h2>How to Get to Naivasha</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          <b>Lake Naivasha</b> is easily accessible via flight and road. Travelling to Lake Naivasha depends on which route you choose to travel from. <b>Via Air</b>: The closest international airport is the Nairobi Airport or the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport through which most visitors come to Lake Naivasha. Some of the airlines that operate here are Kenya Airways, Egypt Air, Emirates, Air Arabia, Lufthansa, KLM, South African Airways and many others. Naivasha is located about 2-hours away from Nairobi. The fastest way to get to Naivasha is through private means. Visiting Naivasha is the perfect excuse to go on a road trip. You can either use the Old Naivasha route from Nairobi, which passes by Maai Mahiu or the Nairobi-Nakuru Highway. If using public means, board a matatu from Accra Road in Nairobi CBD, fares start from Kshs.400 per person. Alternatively, you can take the SGR passenger train to Suswa and connect to Naivasha through public means. I’d highly recommend the former options though.
        </p>

        <h2>Best Time to Visit Lake Naivasha</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          You can explore the best of <b>Lake Naivasha</b> throughout the year with it pleasing climatic condition. Talking about the best time to visit Lake Naivasha, the months from June to October are considered as the best time to travel around, exploring the wildlife and the scenic beauty. These are the summer season with hot days but bearable situation for a safari.  The winters are even considered ideal for the tour of Lake Naivasha as the climate is cold and pleasing. However, there may be a little rain but overall, the temperature is ideal for an excursion to Lake Naivasha.

        <h2>Hells Gate National Park</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Hell’s Gate National Park is staggeringly beautiful. The Lion King based their interpretation of Africa on this park, its towering crags, deep riverine canyons, acres of savannah, obsidian caves, hot springs and volcanic activities make this small park a hit with photographers and nature enthusiasts. It’s one of the few parks in Kenya where you can cycle or walk freely. Hell’s Gate National Park has no elephant, lion or leopard, so hire a bike at the gate and spend your day meandering through the scenery. Hell’s Gate has a fabulously scenic canyon through which you can hike. Used as a location for many films (see it in Tomb Raider) the walls have been carved by water over millennia and twist and turn deep through the rock. The hike can be done without a guide, but it is better to pay the local Maasai to walk you through. Do not enter the canyon if it has rained recently, as people have died in flash floods.

        <h2>Sanctuary Farm</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          Sanctuary Farm is now somewhat smaller than it used to be thanks to the rising lake, but it still commands over 400 acres of wildlife conservancy. <b>Sanctuary Farm</b> is an excellent place to ride horses in Naivasha. Horse riding at Sanctuary Farm allows you to ride alongside zebra, giraffe, impala, gazelle, waterbuck and other animals. The wildlife is less afraid of the horses, so you can get close to them without scaring them off. If you aren’t keen on riding, then you can hire bikes, go on a guided walk, or even take a nighttime game drive in one of the open-top safari vehicles.

          <h2>Lake Naivasha Boat Ride</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            You are here to spend time with <b>Lake Naivasha</b>, so Boating in its freshwater must be your top-end activity. You can take a boat ride for 6500KES ($35) per boat that can hold up to 7 persons. So, if you can make a group of seven, the cost will be much reduced to 500KES. The Boating time will be from one hour to two hours. You can see a different perspective of the town from the lakeside and spot the flora and fauna of the Great Rift Valley. You can spot many groups of Hippos while boating near to them. Furthermore, you can go to Crescent Island by boat too. Lake Naivasha is a beautiful lake full of birds and hippos. A Lake Naivasha boat trip is highly recommended. You will most likely spot hippos, herons, pelicans and dozens of other birds. With a little luck, you can even see a lost flamingo. These animals used to be found in Lake Naivasha, but due to the rise in water levels, they have been migrated to neighboring lakes such as Lake Nakuru and <b>Lake Baringo</b>.      
          </p>
          <h2>A day Visit to Crescent Island</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Crescent Island is a small private island in <b>Lake Naivasha</b>. It is a peninsula and it is among the cool things to visit this island. Again, here you can find many wild animals like Zebras, Giraffes, and Impalas. It is also one of those places in Kenya where you can walk through between Zebras, Giraffes, and other animals. The island is also ideal for activities such as hiking, biking, walking, and weekend retreats. However, at present, it is accessible only from Waterside. It has an entry fee of 60$
          </p>
